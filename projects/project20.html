      Concept
    </h2>

    <p style="margin-bottom:56px;">
      Throughout our participation in the symposium in Moghrytsia, one particular site repeatedly drew our attention: a cliff at the edge of the Cretaceous quarry, distinguished by its complex and highly expressive geological structure. Over the course of three years, we returned to this place, observing it and considering what kind of intervention might be appropriate within such a context.
<br>
Gradually, it became clear that we did not seek to introduce a new form or object into this landscape. Instead, our intention was to direct attention to the site itself, to the beauty and internal logic already present there. The work emerged not as an act of addition, but as a gesture of focus and recognition.
<br>
In this sense, the project can be understood as a form of study. Much like painters or graphic artists who reproduce the works of acknowledged masters in order to refine their understanding of form and technique, we chose to “recreate” the work of the most accomplished author of environmental form: the landscape itself. The intervention functions as an act of careful repetition, emphasizing structure, rhythm, and proportion, while acknowledging nature as both material and author.
