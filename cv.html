The creative association has existed since 2015, from the first joint project created at the winter festival of land art Mithogenesis (Vinnytsia, Ukraine). Both participants - Marharyta Zhurunova from the city of Vinnytsia (11/29/1994) and Bohdan Lokatyr from Lviv (05/04/1993) studied together at the Ukrainian Academy of Printing and became partners and co-authors.
The main activities of the duo are land, environmental and site specific art. The preferred theme are mutual influence of the person and the landscape, toxic manifestations of it. Of course, after February 24, 2022, most of the works created are on the theme of war.
In 2019 both artists became laureates of the President of Ukraine scholarships for young writers and artists, and received also a grant from the President of Ukraine.
